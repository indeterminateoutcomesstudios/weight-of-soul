Volume 1 - Preamble

[---TO DO---

DAY THREE

---I See Dead People---

This is another of those large exploration scenes. The Channelwork has been put under quarantine (rations xd) and the roads are blocked off forcing Marid to take an alternate route. However she can also see ghosts, which opens up more of the city Metroidvania style.

Basic flowchart:
- Marid wakes up in Cavala's clinic and gets the rundown. We get our first tutorial of talking to ghosts by speaking with Reden's ghost.
- Reden's ghost is strangely broken but we get an image of where he was before he died: somewhere in a canal. This can only mean one of the Channelworks pipes, which we will later see is "Reden's Haunt."
- The way between VT west end and VT west street is blocked, but Marid can circumvent it through the alley.
- Marid can talk to Carnicer's ghost (slightly frayed from the reality bending) which results in her learning a little bit about the operation, but not Justinian's identity.
- The way east across the canal is blocked, both Cadaver Walk and the VT bridge. However we can now go into Canalside Steps and take the iron door, which leads us through a short puzzle room (Hidden Passage) into a secret mutant church (Church of One Thousand Faces). Here they are doing weird pre-science cult stuff in worship of the hydra Anu Va. She can speak with ghosts and church leaders who explain that this was the only way for them to worship in the face of brutal persecution.
- Marid heads north from there and ends up in the belly of the Channelworks where she finds Reden's Haunt. She realizes that this black liquid is leaking from inside, which she follows to discover Noctis Storage and Justinian's notes on the thing. She has to search around to find the key to snoop deeper inside the Channelworks complex.
- Heading up from Noctis Storage she encounters Doctor Serpens and has to hide to not be murdered. Soon however Justinian arrives and talks Serpens down. Marid is found by Justinian... and imprisoned. CUE VILLAIN MONOLOGUE! CUE DAY 4!

Part 1.1.2 - Extensions

Include Approaches by Emily Short.
Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.
Include Menus by Emily Short.

Part 1.1.3 - Miscellaneous Functions

The update chronological records rule is not listed in any rulebook.

The previous location is a room that varies.
Before reading a command (this is the update previous location rule):
	now the previous location is the location.
	
[This is part of a general movement to reduce reliance on the "update chronological records" rule, which becomes really slow on Quixe if you have too many past tense checks in the game.]

To say wait for any key: wait for any key.

[This allows us to write it directly inside the text without having to rely on tedious substitutions. Dangerous for cases where the text may be expanded, but useful for dialogue trees and scripted events using tables.]

This is the rest of the turn rule:
	follow the scene changing rules;
	follow the every turn rules;
	abide by the timed events rule;
	abide by the advance time rule;
	abide by the adjust light rule;
	abide by the note object acquisitions rule;
	abide by the notify score changes rule;
	follow the scene changing rules.

[This is the turn sequence rules minus the part that parses and follows a command. We use the 'rest of the turn rule' later when we reject the player's command but still want to advance the turn.]

Understand "i" as 1.
Understand "ii" as 2.
Understand "iii" as 3.
Understand "iv" as 4.
Understand "v" as 5.
Understand "vi" as 6.
Understand "vii" as 7.
Understand "viii" as 8.
Understand "ix" as 9.
Understand "x" as 10.

[I dunno, flavor I guess.]

Part 1.1.4 - Tweaked Extension Functionality

A room can be goto-passable or goto-impassable. A room is usually goto-passable.

This is the new approach-heading selection rule:
	now approach-heading is the best route from the location to the noun through goto-passable visited rooms, using doors;
	if approach-heading is not a direction:
		now approach-heading is the best route from the location to the noun through goto-passable visited rooms, using even locked doors;
	if approach-heading is not a direction:
		now approach-heading is the best route from the location to the noun through visited rooms, using even locked doors;
		if approach-heading is a direction:
			say "You can't go back that way.";
			rule fails.
			
The new approach-heading selection rule is listed instead of the approach-heading selection rule in the approach-finding rules.

[This allows us to make certain rooms impassable for approaching on the fly, which is handy when the player is barred from entering certain rooms by means other than locked doors.]

The unlocking before opening rule is not listed in any rulebook. [I didn't really want to include Locksmith, or this behavior.]

Part 1.1.5 - Room Names

A room has some text called the simple-name.

Rule for printing the name of a room (called the room in question) while the player is hurrying:
	say "[if the simple-name of the room in question is not empty][simple-name of the room in question][otherwise][printed name of the room in question][end if]";

Rule for printing the name of a room (called the room in question) while asking which do you mean:
	say "[if the simple-name of the room in question is not empty][simple-name of the room in question][otherwise][printed name of the room in question][end if]";
	
Rule for printing the name of a room (called the room in question) while clarifying the parser's choice of something:
	say "[if the simple-name of the room in question is not empty][simple-name of the room in question][otherwise][printed name of the room in question][end if]";

The can't approach our current location rule response (A) is "You are already in [if the simple-name of the location is not empty][simple-name of the location][otherwise][printed name of the location][end if]."

[The default Inform behavior for printing the names of rooms is weird. This allows us to define an alternate string in certain cases.

It turns out we call the simple-name most of the time, so I never experienced the recursion case until a baffling bug involving Cadaver Walk and its lack of a simple-name. It turns out that the distinction between [the room in question] and [printed name of the room in question] is extremely fucking important.]

Part 1.1.6 - Ending Options

When play begins (this is the new final question options rule):
	choose row 1 in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now the final question wording entry is ">[bold type]restart[roman type]";
	choose row 2 in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now the final question wording entry is ">[bold type]restore[roman type] a saved story";
	choose row 3 in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now the final question wording entry is "see some suggestions for >[bold type]amusing[roman type] things to do";
	choose row 4 in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now the final question wording entry is ">[bold type]quit[roman type]";
	choose row 5 in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now the final question wording entry is ">[bold type]undo[roman type] the last command";
	
The print the final prompt rule response (A) is ">[run paragraph on]".

Part 1.1.7 - Debug Messages - Release for testing

After printing the banner text, say "[line break](This is an unfinished playtest build of [italic type]The Weight of a Soul[roman type]. Type >[bold type]playtest[roman type] to see a special message for playtesters like you.)";
	
Understand "playtest" as a mistake ("[tester-commands-text]").
Understand "skip commands" as a mistake ("[skip-commands-text]").

First after reading a command (this is the playtest comments rule):
	let T be "[the player's command]";
	if character number 1 in T is "*":
		say "Comment recorded.";
		reject the player's command.

To say tester-commands-text:
	say "When you start a playthrough, please type >[bold type]transcript[roman type]. This will save the text of your playthrough to your browser cache. When you're done, type >[bold type]load[roman type], click 'Edit', copy the text of your transcript, and send it to me.

	say "To leave a comment during your playthrough, type a command that begins with an asterisk (a [bold type]*[roman type] symbol).

	say "The game includes a skip feature to instantly progress the story to various checkpoints. To see the currently available skip commands, type >[bold type]skip commands[roman type] (mild spoilers).[paragraph break]";

Part 1.2.2 - Status Line

Chapter 1.2.2.1 - Status Line Variables

[We want to show the current day on the right hand status line. We use a variable to store it because a) there can be multiple concurrent scenes, so Inform doesn't know which one is relevant; and b) entering a dialogue changes the status line, and we'd like a foolproof way to restore it.]

The current day is a scene that varies. The current day is Prologue.
When Day One begins: now the current day is Day One.
When Day Two begins: now the current day is Day Two.
When Midnight begins: now the current day is Midnight.
When Day Three begins: now the current day is Day Three.
When Day Four begins: now the current day is Day Four.
When Epilogue begins: now the current day is Epilogue.

[When the player is engaged in dialogue, the right hand status line instead changes to "Talking to [the partner]". We likewise need a variable for this.]

The conversational partner text is some text that varies.

Chapter 1.2.2.2 - Constructing the Status Line

[We use Basic Screen Effects to construct the status line so that we can shift the right hand status line inward when it's too long. "Talking to Doctor Cavala" is a lot longer than 14 characters. We define the tables and rule for constructing the status line here; the actual shifting is dynamically done while starting and ending the dialogue.]

Table of Normal Status
left	central	right
" [location]"	""	"[if the current day is Prologue or the current day is Midnight or the current day is Epilogue][otherwise][current day]"

Table of Dialogue Status
left	central	right
" [location]"	""	"[conversational partner text]"

Table of Endoscopy Status
left	central	right
" [location]"	""	"[endoscopic subject text]"

Rule for constructing the status line:
	if the player is engaged in dialogue:
		fill status bar with Table of Dialogue Status;
	otherwise if the player is engaged in endoscopy:
		fill status bar with Table of Endoscopy Status;
	otherwise:
		fill status bar with Table of Normal Status;
	rule succeeds.

Book 1.3 - People

Part 1.3.1 - Defining People

[This game includes a lot of interacting with people, and Inform's boilerplate facilities in this regard are lacking. The setting also introduces some hurdles because people can be of different fantasy races. Here we lay the groundwork for that by assigning new properties to people and letting the player refer to people by their properties.]

Definition: a person is other if it is not the player.
Does the player mean doing something with the player: it is unlikely.

A person can be friendly or hostile. A person is usually friendly. [This flag colors Marid's responses when interacting with that person.]

Understand "person" as a person. Understand "people" as the plural of a person. Understand "man" as a male person. Understand "men" as the plural of a male person. Understand "woman" as a female person. Understand "women" as the plural of a female person.

A person can be living, dead, or ghostly. A person is usually living. Understand "dead" or "body" or "corpse" or "cadaver" as a dead person.  Understand "ghost" or "spirit" or "animus" as a ghostly person. 

Race is a kind of value. The races are human, goblin, mutant, mixed-race, and creature. A person has a race. The race of a person is usually human. Understand the race property as describing a person.
Understand "humans" as the plural of a human person. Understand "goblins" as the plural of a goblin person. Understand "mutants" as the plural of a mutant person.
Understand "human/goblin/mutant" as a mixed-race person. Understand "humans/goblins/mutants" as the plural of a mixed-race person.

mutant-tutorial-shown is a truth state that varies. mutant-tutorial-shown is false.

First before examining or talking to a mutant person when mutant-tutorial-shown is false (this is the 'what's a mutant'? tutorial rule):
	if time is not critical:
		say "(It has been some years now since the mutants of the Dark Lands were integrated into society, and you have mostly gotten used to their haphazard anatomy, their alien perception of the world. Mostly.)[paragraph break]";
		now mutant-tutorial-shown is true.
		
Part 1.3.2 - People Block Responses

The sound of a person is usually "[regarding the item described][They] [are][if the item described is dead] silent.[otherwise]n't saying anything."
		
Instead of drinking, switching on, switching off, or wearing someone (this is the can't do that to a person rule): say "That doesn't make any sense."
Instead of setting someone to something (this is the can't set people rule): say "That doesn't make any sense."

Instead of looking under something carried by an other living person (called the carrier), say "[regarding the noun][They're] what [the carrier] [are] carrying."
Instead of looking under something worn by an other living person (called the wearer), say "[regarding the noun][They're] what [the wearer] [are] wearing."

Instead of eating a living person, say "What a strange notion."
Instead of taking an other living non-faraway person (this is the new can't take people response rule): say "[regarding the noun]You lack the strength, even if [they] allowed you to."

Instead of attacking, cutting, knocking on, or pushing an other friendly non-faraway living person (this is the can't hurt friendly people rule): say "[if time is critical]This is not the time.[otherwise]That hardly seems called for."
Instead of kissing, pulling, rubbing, searching, smelling, swinging, squeezing, touching, or turning an other friendly non-faraway living person (this is the block actions on friendly people rule): say "[if time is critical]This is not the time.[otherwise]You aren't [italic type]that[roman type] friendly with [the noun]."

Instead of attacking or cutting an other hostile non-faraway living person (this is the can't hurt hostile people rule): say "You doubt that would end well for you."
Instead of knocking on, pulling, pushing, smelling, squeezing, touching, or turning an other hostile non-faraway living person (this is the can't provoke hostile people rule): say "You doubt that would go over well with [the noun]."
Instead of kissing, rubbing, or searching an other hostile non-faraway living person (this is the block actions on hostile people rule), say "You doubt [the noun] will let you do that."

Instead of eating a dead person, say "What a revolting notion."
Instead of eating something that is part of a dead person, say "What a revolting notion."
Instead of giving something to a dead person, say "You won't get much of a response."

Instead of knocking on, pushing, pulling, squeezing, swinging, taking, touching, or turning a ghostly non-faraway person, say "You grasp nothing but air."
Instead of searching a ghostly person, say "You won't find anything for the living."
Instead of kissing a ghostly person, say "Unlikely."
Instead of waking a ghostly person, say "[regarding the noun][Theirs] is a sleep from which there is no awakening."

Part 1.3.3 - Recurring Characters

[These are important characters who show up several times in various locations throughout the game. They were originally listed in the location of their first appearance, but as the plot gets more convoluted and characters shift around more, placing these characters here makes them easier to keep track of.]

Chapter 1.3.3.1 - Doctor Cavala

[Doctor Cavala is a mentor/parent figure to Marid. She's tough, stoic, and competent -- qualities which Marid tried to emulate as she grew up.

Initially she serves a questgiver role and gives the player direction while they're finding their feet. She's a little too active and competent for a mentor, and would usurp the story from Marid if she could, so she ends up incapacitated and forced to serve a support role halfway through the game.

Doctor Cavala's name comes from the Latin "caballa" / French "cavalier." The goblin forewoman references this, calling her a "warhorse."]

Doctor Cavala is a woman.
The scent is "[if time is critical]Doctor Cavala is sweating.[otherwise]Doctor Cavala never wears perfume, owing to the danger of contamination during surgery."
Understand "dark-skinned" or "physician" or "dr" as Cavala.

Doctor Cavala can be able-bodied or incapacitated. She is able-bodied.

The description of Doctor Cavala is "[first time]You came to know Doctor Cavala when she served with Lumina's volunteers during the troubles. Her clinic was your first choice for apprenticeship when you graduated. Since then you've watched her drag more than a few souls kicking from the brink of death -- and they won't be the last, not if she has anything to say about it.

Doctor Cavala is a dark-skinned physician in her early forties, sharp and regal of bearing. [only][cavala-description]".

To say cavala-description:
	if Reden's Surgery is happening:
		say "She circles the gurney with increasing agitation, doing all she can to keep her patient alive. ";
	otherwise if Walking Home in Darkness is happening:
		say "Right now, she appears to be filling out a census report for Reden's death. ";
	otherwise if Reden's Autopsy is happening:
		say "She has a look of absolute concentration on her face. ";
	otherwise if Walking Home in Fear is happening:
		say "She's taking her injury rather well -- but then again, she [italic type]was[roman type] an army doctor. ";
	otherwise if All Quiet on the Western Front is happening:
		if A Crucible Game is happening:
			say "She's looking at her cards with a cool, unreadable expression. ";
		otherwise:
			say "She looks frankly irritated that she's bedridden. ";
	otherwise if Heroes Never Die is happening:
		say "She's looking at you like you've swallowed a bee. ";
	otherwise:
		say "She seems to be at a crossroads, lost in thought. ".
		
Doctor Cavala's leg is a thing.
The description is "[if First Aid on Cavala is happening and Doctor Cavala is wearing the hermetically sealed bandage]You hope the bleeding has subsided.[otherwise if First Aid on Cavala is happening]It's a ragged bloody tear.[otherwise]If Doctor Cavala feels any pain, she doesn't show it."
The scent is "[if First Aid on Cavala is happening]The scent of blood is thick.[otherwise]You smell the calomel in the dressing."
Understand "left" or "thigh/knee/tendon" or "cut/gash/wound/tear/injury" or "blood/bloody/bleeding" or "trouser/trousers" as Doctor Cavala's leg.
Before bandaging Doctor Cavala's leg with, try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the second noun instead.
Instead of taking off Doctor Cavala's leg, say "Taking off Doctor Cavala's trousers might cause more trauma. You have to stop the bleeding first."
Instead of attacking, cutting, knocking on, pushing, pulling, rubbing, squeezing, swinging, taking, touching, or turning Doctor Cavala's leg, say "[if time is critical]This is not the time.[otherwise]That would worsen her injury."

The hermetically sealed bandage is a wearable thing.
The description is "Doctor Cavala's knee has been bandaged tightly."
The scent is "You smell the calomel in the dressing."
Understand "antiseptic" or "dressing" or "bandages" or "calomel" or "solution" or "gauze" or "natron" or "sigil/sigils" or "fabric" as the hermetically sealed bandage.
Instead of attacking, cutting, knocking on, pushing, pulling, looking under, rubbing, squeezing, swinging, taking, touching, or turning the hermetically sealed bandage, say "[if time is critical]This is not the time.[otherwise]The bandage shouldn't be disturbed until a more qualified surgeon arrives. [first time](And Doctor Cavala can't exactly operate on herself.) [only][line break]"
		
Instead of bandaging Doctor Cavala with when Doctor Cavala is wearing the hermetically sealed bandage: say "Doctor Cavala's wound is already bandaged."

Chapter 1.3.3.2 - Horatio

[Horatio began as a throwaway character but has evolved into a contrast to Justinian, the main villain. (Spoilers!) Unlike Justinian, whose ambition leads him to instigate the events of the game, Horatio is just this happy-go-lucky dude who takes care of Marid and reminds her that she doesn't need some big quest to find happiness in her life.

I'd like to pretend Horatio is named after the character in Hamlet but he was actually named after Horatio Hornblower. There's no real reason for this other than I thought it sounded like a Solphosian name.]

Horatio is an undescribed man.
The description is "[horatio-description]".
The scent is "Horatio smells like sweat and ozone."
Understand "vigile" as Horatio.

To say horatio-description:
	if Cavala's Errands is happening:
		say "Vigile Horatio is a childhood friend of yours. He's always been a bit dense, but you're glad to have him around. ";
	otherwise if Walking Home in Fear is happening:
		say "At least he seems to be making himself useful. ";
	otherwise if All Quiet on the Western Front is happening:
		if A Crucible Game is happening:
			say "Horatio is contemplating his hand of cards. ";
		otherwise:
			say "He looks more bored than anything. ";
	otherwise:
		say "He looks bemused, as though at a loss. ";

Chapter 1.3.3.3 - Carnicer

[Carnicer is the "miniboss" of the first half of the game. A lackey of the antagonist, she provides a sense of urgency in the game's beginning, and lets us toss in some action before Marid really knows what's going on. We also use her to remove Doctor Cavala from the playing field, and to give Marid superpowers from her near-death experience.

Carnicer means "butcher" in Latin.]

Carnicer is an undescribed hostile improper-named mutant woman.
The printed name is "[if Carnicer is improper-named]assassin[otherwise]Carnicer[end if]".
The scent is "The scent of blood."
Understand "hooded" or "assassin" or "killer" or "butcher" or "claw/claws/head" as Carnicer.
Understand "stranger" as Carnicer when Averting Cavala's Assassination is happening.

The description of Carnicer is "[if Rooftop Pursuit has not ended]She's far too close for comfort[otherwise if Midnight has not ended]You know she's waiting for you[otherwise]Placeholder[end if]."

Carnicer has some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "You didn't come this far to commit suicide."

Carnicer's blade is an improper-named thing. It is carried by Carnicer.
The printed name is "[Carnicer]'s blade".
The description is "Serrated."
Understand "sword" or "assassin's" as Carnicer's blade.
Does the player mean doing something with Carnicer's blade: it is likely.

Carnicer's smile is an improper-named thing. It is part of Carnicer.
The printed name is "[Carnicer]'s smile".
The description is "You can't look away."
Understand "grin" or "tooth/teeth" or "hood/cloak" or "assassin's" as Carnicer's smile.

Rule for writing a paragraph about Carnicer when Highway to Hell is happening:
	say "In the corridor, the assassin paces back and forth.";

Chapter 1.3.3.4 - Justinian

[Justinian is the main antagonist of the game. He's a dark mirror to Marid: having gone through much of the same navel-gazing and agonizing over death, he's decided that he will be the master of his destiny and turn death into his own personal tool. In killing, he seeks to preserve life.

Justinian has been a difficult character to write because a) we need to preserve the plot twist, and b) Marid has a raging fangirl crush on him. This means every interaction with Justinian has had like three layers of meaning.

Justinian is named after Emperor Justinian of the Byzantine Empire, as befitting his ambition.]

Justinian is a human man.
The description is "[justinian-description]".
The scent is "[if time is critical]This is not the time[otherwise]You can't get distracted by his cologne, not now[end if]."
Understand "doctor" or "justin" or "volontis" as Justinian.

To say justinian-description:
	if Four Investigations is happening:
		say "His eyes are dark sunsets. ";
	otherwise if Heroes Never Die is happening:
		say "He returns your gaze uneasily. ";
	otherwise:
		say "You shouldn't look at him. You'll start fantasizing. ";
	
Instead of kissing, rubbing, or touching Justinian:
	if time is critical:
		say "This is not the time.";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]No. No! No. Yes -- [italic type]No![roman type][or]Absolutely not.[stopping]";
	
Instead of attacking, cutting, or pushing Justinian:
	if time is critical:
		say "This is not the time.";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]What? No! Why would you even consider that?[or]Absolutely not.[stopping]";

Instead of knocking on, pulling, searching, swinging, squeezing, taking, or turning Justinian:
	if time is critical:
		say "This is not the time.";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]No. No! That would -- that would be much too forward.[or]You can't bring yourself to.[stopping]";
		
Chapter 1.3.3.5 - Doctor Serpens

[Doctor Serpens is another minor antagonist. He's a corrupt "establishment man" who has agreed to join Justinian's plan for the opportunity to advance his career. Narratively, he serves the purpose of escalating the stakes after Carnicer's death, and provides a decoy villain to mask the twist of Justinian being the antagonist.]

Doctor Serpens is a hostile human man.

Book 1.4 - When Time is Critical, When It is Night

["When time is critical" - This is used to flag the player at certain tense times so that comedic and relaxed responses don't trigger.]

To decide whether time is critical:
	if Reden's Surgery is happening, decide yes;
	if the location is the Condemned Block, decide yes;
	if the location is the Shanty Quarter, decide yes;
	if the location is Rats' Run, decide yes;

	if the location is in the Shanty Maze, decide yes;

Book 1.5 - Sounds, Scents

[I want to provide unique descriptions for smelling, listening, and so on. This saves us a lot of instead rules and hopefully cuts down on action-processing time.]

A room has some text called the sound.
A thing has some text called the sound.
A room has some text called the scent.
A thing has some text called the scent.

The report listening rule is not listed in the report listening to rulebook.
The report smelling rule is not listed in the report smelling rulebook.
	
Report listening (this is the new report listening rule):
	if the sound of the noun is not empty:
		say "[sound of the noun][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "You hear nothing unexpected."

Report smelling (this is the new report smelling rule):
	if the scent of the noun is not empty:
		say "[scent of the noun][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "You smell nothing unexpected."

Book 1.6 - Faraway Things

[This game has a lot of scenery that you can see but not interact with. This is a tag for those things to consolidate all the instead rules into a single rule.]

A thing can be faraway or non-faraway. A thing is usually non-faraway.

Last instead of doing something (this is the can't generally interact with faraway things rule):
	let N be an object;
	if action requires a touchable noun:
		if the noun is part of a faraway thing (called the parent):
			now N is the parent;
		otherwise if the noun is faraway:
			now N is the noun;
	otherwise if action requires a touchable second noun:
		if the second noun is part of a faraway thing (called the parent):
			now N is the parent;
		otherwise if the second noun is faraway:
			now N is the second noun;
	if N is a thing:
		if we are listening to N, continue the action;
		if we are smelling N and the scent of N is not empty, continue the action;
		if N provides the property faraway response:
			say "[faraway response of N][line break]";
		otherwise:
			say "[They're] too far away.";
	otherwise:
		continue the action.
		
The can't reach inside rooms rule response (A) is "That's too far away."

Section 2.3.2.1.1 - ">" as a Synonym for Looking

[Parser hack courtesy of matt w. He writes:
	
	"What I've done is I've commented out the part of "Reading the Command" that handles "if the line was blank, get a fresh line." Then I use an "After reading a command" rule to handle the case where there's a blank command, by changing the command to what you want. I haven't checked it with undo and "end the story," but it might be safer than trying to hand-roll the turn sequence. Though I daren't ever say that messing with the parser template code is safe."

I use matt w's hack instead of changing the "I beg your pardon" error message so that the game runs all of the appropriate turn sequence code -- including "undo" save states and "end the story" triggers -- which aren't covered by the "rest of the turn rule" in Part 1.1.3.]
		
First after reading a command (this is the accept Blue Lacuna style looking rule):
	if the number of characters in "[the player's command]" is 0:

		say "That isn't a place you've visited in this game yet[if player-knows-go is false].[paragraph break](Try going in a direction instead. For example, >[bold type]go south[roman type].)[otherwise]." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "That is either not important or not something you can see.[line break][if look-reminder-printed is false][line break](Type >[bold type]look[roman type] or a blank command to examine your surroundings.)";
		now look-reminder-printed is true.
	
Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the can't use multiple objects error (this is the new can't use multiple objects rule):
	say "You'll have to specify which one." instead.

	say "(Use the command >[bold type]talk to[roman type] or >[bold type]t[roman type] to converse with other characters.)" instead.

Part 2.3.5 - New Action Behavior

player-knows-look is a truth state that varies.
Before looking when player-knows-look is false (this is the so you do know how to look rule):
	now player-knows-look is true;
	continue the action.

player-knows-go is a truth state that varies.
Before going a direction when player-knows-go is false (this is the so you do know how to go rule):
	now player-knows-go is true;
	continue the action.

After opening (this is the reveal any newly visible interior even if it contains nothing rule):
	if the noun is an opaque container and
		the noun contains nothing and
		the noun does not enclose the actor:
		if the action is not silent, say "[We] [open] [the noun]. [They're] empty.";
	otherwise:
		continue the action.
		
Does the player mean entering something:
	if the noun is not a door and the noun is not enterable, it is unlikely;
	make no decision.

Part 2.3.6 - Implicit Actions

A door can be better kept closed or better left open. A door is usually better kept closed.

After going through a door (called the traversed door) (this is the close doors after going through them rule):
	if the traversed door is openable and the traversed door is better kept closed:
		if the player is staid, say "(closing the door[if the traversed door is plural-named]s[end if] behind you)[command clarification break]";
		try silently closing the traversed door;
	continue the action.
	
Rule for issuing the response text of the opening doors before entering rule response (A) while the player is hurrying (this is the suppress implicit door-opening messages while approaching rule): say "[run paragraph on]".

Part 2.3.7 - Emptying It Into

[For some reason, I implemented this for a single object in the middle of nowhere that doesn't actually provide any clues. And isn't a container, for that matter.]

Emptying it into is an action applying to two things.
Understand "empty [something preferably held]" as emptying it into.
Understand "empty [something preferably held] in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.
Understand "empty out [something preferably held]" as emptying it into.
Understand "empty out [something preferably held] in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.
Understand "empty [something preferably held] out" as emptying it into.
Understand "empty [something preferably held] out in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour [something preferably held]" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour [something preferably held] in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour out [something preferably held]" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour out [something preferably held] in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour [something preferably held] out" as emptying it into.
Understand "pour [something preferably held] out in/into/on/onto/over [something]" as emptying it into.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while emptying (this is the emptying into the location rule):
	now the second noun is the location.

Check emptying (this is the can't empty something that's not a container rule):
	if the noun is not a container:
		say "[The noun] [are]n't something you can empty.";
		stop the action.
		
Check emptying (this is the can't empty something into something that can't enclose things rule):
	if the second noun is not a room and the second noun is not a container and the second noun is not a supporter:
		say "[The second noun] [are]n't something you can empty things into.";
		stop the action.
		
Check emptying (this is the can't empty something that's already empty rule):
	if the noun contains nothing:
		say "[The noun] [are] already empty.";
		stop the action.
		
Check emptying (this is the can't empty something that's closed rule):
	if the noun is closed:
		say "(first opening [the noun])[command clarification break]";
		try silently opening the noun;
	if the noun is closed, stop the action.
	
Carry out emptying (this is the standard emptying rule):
	if the second noun is a supporter:
		now all things in the noun are on the second noun;
	otherwise:
		now all things in the noun are in the second noun.
			
Report emptying (this is the report emptying rule):
	if the second noun is a supporter:
		say "You empty [the noun] onto [the second noun].";
	otherwise:
		say "You empty [the noun] into [the second noun]."
		
Part 2.3.8 - Listing Exits and Going-In Disambiguation

A room has some text called the exit reminder.

Listing exits is an action out of world. Understand "exits" as listing exits.
Instead of going nowhere, try listing exits instead.

Report listing exits (this is the report listing exits rule):
	if the player is engaged in endoscopy:
		say "[exit reminder of the endoscopic location][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "[exit reminder of the location][line break]".
	
A room has some text called the going-in disambiguation.

First instead of going when the noun is inside and the going-in disambiguation of the location is not empty (this is the provide going-in disambiguation rule):
	say "[going-in disambiguation of the location][line break]".

Part 2.3.9 - Dialogue System

[In case you didn't realize, this game has a lot of talking. I decided to go with Planescape: Torment style multiple choice dialogue because let's be real, ASK/TELL is the least fun topic-guessing gameplay ever devised.]

Chapter 2.3.9.1 - Dialogue Branches

A dialogue branch is a kind of object.

A dialogue branch has a truth state called enabled. Enabled is usually true. [If a branch is not enabled, it doesn't show up as a possible choice in the command prompt.]

A dialogue branch has a truth state called one-shot. One-shot is usually false. [A one-shot branch disables itself after being read out.]

A dialogue branch has some text called the prompt. The prompt of a dialogue branch is usually "[printed name] (no prompt)". [The prompt is the text that labels the option to choose the branch.]

A dialogue branch has some text called the description. [The description is the text displayed when the branch is chosen.]

A dialogue branch has a list of dialogue branches called the choices. [These are the child branches of the branch.]

A person has a dialogue branch called the home dialogue branch. [This flag indicates the default branch when you TALK TO someone.]

The null dialogue branch is a dialogue branch. The home dialogue branch of a person is usually the null dialogue branch. [A placeholder to prevent runtime errors due to not defining dialogue for someone.] The description of the null dialogue branch is "[bold type]Error:[roman type] Attempted to read out null dialogue branch."

[If a branch has no children, it will end the dialogue upon being read out.]

Wait for any key before prompt switch is a truth state that varies. [This is switched on when we want to wait for any key before providing the command prompt.]

Look-pending switch is a truth state that varies. [This is switched on when we want to look after ending a dialogue.]

To say wait for any key before prompt:
	now the wait for any key before prompt switch is true.

To say look pending:
	follow the scene changing rules;
	now look-pending switch is true;
	wait for any key.

Chapter 2.3.9.2 - Tearing Out Inform Dialogue

Understand the commands "ask" and "tell" and "say" and "answer" and "yes" and "no" and "sorry" as something new.

Understand "ask [text]" or "tell [text]" or "answer [text]" or "say [text]" or "insult [text]" or "compliment [text]" or "flirt [text]" or "greet [text]" or "whisper [text]" or "wave at/to [text]" or "report [text]" or "hello" or "hi" or "ok" or "okay" or "nod" or "shake head" or "wave" or "yes" or "no" or "sorry" as a mistake ("(Use the command >[bold type]talk to[roman type] or >[bold type]t[roman type] to converse with other characters.)").

Understand "wave hello" or "wave hello [text]" or "wave goodbye" or "wave goodbye [text]" as a mistake ("(Use the command >[bold type]talk to[roman type] or >[bold type]t[roman type] to converse with other characters.)"). [Because OF COURSE wxd tried this]

Instead of asking someone to try doing something, say "(Use the command >[bold type]talk to[roman type] or >[bold type]t[roman type] to converse with other characters.)"
Instead of answering someone that something, say "(Use the command >[bold type]talk to[roman type] or >[bold type]t[roman type] to converse with other characters.)"

Chapter 2.3.9.3 - Engaged in Dialogue

Yourself can be engaged in dialogue. Yourself is not engaged in dialogue.

The available dialogue choices is a list of dialogue branches that varies.

Reading out something is an activity on dialogue branches. [This activity is what translates the dialogue branch object into displayed text and provides the appropriate dialogue choices. We make it an activity rather than a function so we can write "Before reading out X..." or "After reading out X..."]

To read out (current branch - a dialogue branch):
	carry out the reading out activity with the current branch. [A more convenient and human-readable way to say the same thing.]
	
Rule for reading out a dialogue branch (called the current branch):
	say "[description of the current branch][if the description of the current branch is not empty and look-pending switch is false][line break]";
	if the one-shot of the current branch is true, now the enabled of the current branch is false;
			
Last after reading out a dialogue branch (called the current branch) (this is the end the dialogue after reading out a dialogue branch with no choices rule): [This is separated from the main 'reading out' rule because the 'after reading out' rules may change the conditions of a scene change or what dialogue choices are available.]
	change the available dialogue choices to have 0 entries;
	repeat with current child running through the choices of current branch:
		if the enabled of current child is true, add current child to the available dialogue choices;
	if the number of entries in the available dialogue choices is 0:
		end the dialogue; 		
	
Chapter 2.3.9.4 - Dialogue Command Prompt

To say dialogue-cmd-prompt:
	if the number of entries in the available dialogue choices is 0:
		say "[bold type]Error:[roman type] Attempted to print the dialogue command prompt with no available choices. Now ending the dialogue...[line break]";
		end the dialogue;
	otherwise:
		say italic type;
		if the wait for any key before prompt switch is true:
			wait for any key;
			now the wait for any key before prompt switch is false;
		repeat with N running from 1 to the number of entries in the available dialogue choices:
			say "[N]) [prompt of entry N in the available dialogue choices][line break]";
		say roman type;
	say "[line break]>".
	
After reading a command while the player is engaged in dialogue (this is the reading a command during dialogue rule):
	if the player's command matches "[number]":
		let N be the number understood;
		if N > 0 and N <= the number of entries in the available dialogue choices:
			read out entry N in the available dialogue choices;
			reject the player's command;
			stop;
	unless the player's command matches "quit/q/save/restore/load/restart":
		say "Please choose a response from the list by typing the corresponding number.";
		reject the player's command.

First turn sequence rule (this is the time doesn't pass during dialogue rule):
	if the player is engaged in dialogue, rule fails.

Chapter 2.3.9.5 - Starting and Ending a Dialogue

To start a dialogue with (provided partner - a thing):
	if the home dialogue branch of the provided partner is not the null dialogue branch:
		now the conversational partner text is "Talking to [the provided partner]";
		if the number of characters in the conversational partner text is greater than 14, now right alignment depth is the number of characters in the conversational partner text;
		now the command prompt is "[dialogue-cmd-prompt]";
		read out the home dialogue branch of the provided partner;
		now the player is engaged in dialogue;
	otherwise:
		say "[bold type]Error:[roman type] Attempted to start a dialogue with [the provided partner] but no home dialogue branch was defined for [them]."
		
To start a dialogue using dialogue (chatter - a dialogue branch):
	now the conversational partner text is "[if the current day is Prologue or the current day is Epilogue][otherwise][current day]";
	if the number of characters in the conversational partner text is greater than 14, now right alignment depth is the number of characters in the conversational partner text;
	now the command prompt is "[dialogue-cmd-prompt]";
	read out the chatter;
	now the player is engaged in dialogue.
		
To start a dialogue saying (provided text - some text) using dialogue (chatter - a dialogue branch):
	now the conversational partner text is the provided text;
	if the number of characters in the conversational partner text is greater than 14, now right alignment depth is the number of characters in the conversational partner text;
	now the command prompt is "[dialogue-cmd-prompt]";
	read out the chatter;
	now the player is engaged in dialogue.

To start a dialogue with (provided partner - a thing) using dialogue (chatter - a dialogue branch):
	now the conversational partner text is "Talking to [the provided partner]";
	if the number of characters in the conversational partner text is greater than 14, now right alignment depth is the number of characters in the conversational partner text;
	now the command prompt is "[dialogue-cmd-prompt]";
	read out the chatter;
	now the player is engaged in dialogue.
	
To end the dialogue:
	now the conversational partner text is "";
	now right alignment depth is 14;
	now the command prompt is ">";
	now the player is not engaged in dialogue;
	if look-pending switch is true, try looking;
	now look-pending switch is false;
	now ambience suppression is true;
	follow the rest of the turn rule.

Chapter 2.3.9.6 - Talking To

Talking to is an action applying to one visible thing.
Understand "t [something]" as talking to.
Understand "talk to/with/-- [something]" as talking to.
Understand "holler at [something]" as talking to.
Understand "scream at [something]" as talking to.
Understand "shout at [something]" as talking to.
Understand "speak to/with/-- [something]" as talking to.
Understand "yell at [something]" as talking to.

Does the player mean talking to something that is not a person: it is unlikely.

Check talking to something that is not a living person (this is the can't talk to inanimate objects rule): say "You won't get much of a response." instead.

Check talking to the player (this is the can't talk to yourself rule): say "You aren't that far gone, Marid." instead.

Check talking to an other person when the home dialogue branch of the noun is the null dialogue branch (this is the can't talk to someone with no home dialogue rule): say "[The noun] [have] nothing to say to you." instead.

Check talking to an other person when the enabled of the home dialogue branch of the noun is false (this is the can't talk to someone with disabled home dialogue rule): say "[The noun] [have] nothing to say to you." instead.

Carry out talking to something (this is the standard talking to rule):
	start a dialogue with the noun.

Part 2.3.10 - Endoscopy

[This is a minigame where we "transport" the player's perspective inside the pathway they inspect. We clear the screen and shift perspective to the endoscope-viewpoint. You can "look," "go," or "examine" a thing in the endoscopic room. Any other action ends the endoscopy.]

Chapter 2.3.10.1 - Definitions

Yourself can be engaged in endoscopy. Yourself is not engaged in endoscopy.

The endoscopic location is a room that varies.

The endoscopic subject text is some text that varies.

The endoscopic-endoscope is a privately-named backdrop.
The printed name is "light from your endoscope".
The description is "A circle of feeble illumination."
Understand "ring/circle" or "of/from" or "your/my" or "light/lens-light/illumination" or "lens/lenses" or "endoscope/scope" as the endoscopic-endoscope.

Chapter 2.3.10.2 - Endoscopic Actions

After deciding the scope of the player while the player is engaged in endoscopy:
	place the endoscopic location in scope;
	place the endoscopic-endoscope in scope.

Does the player mean doing something with a thing enclosed by the endoscopic location when the player is engaged in endoscopy: it is very likely.
Does the player mean doing something with the endoscopic-endoscope when the player is engaged in endoscopy: it is very likely.
Rule for clarifying the parser's choice of something when the player is engaged in endoscopy: do nothing.
	
Last before doing anything when the player is engaged in endoscopy (this is the endoscopic actions rule):
	if we are looking:
		say "[bold type][printed name of the endoscopic location in title case][roman type][line break][run paragraph on with special look spacing]";
		if set to abbreviated room descriptions:
			do nothing;
		otherwise if set to sometimes abbreviated room descriptions and abbreviated form allowed is true and the endoscopic location is visited:
			do nothing;
		otherwise:
			say "[description of the endoscopic location][line break]";
		if the endoscopic location is a room, now the endoscopic location is visited;
		stop the action;
	[A caveat for looking: this is a short-form hack that doesn't describe the locale, so we have to describe all the scenery in the room description. I could make it describe the locale if I wanted to but that is a lot of effort and code for no real gain.]
	otherwise if we are going:
		if the noun is outside:
			end the endoscopy, followed by looking;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if the noun is inside:
			now the noun is down;
		if the room the noun from the endoscopic location is a room:
			if the noun is up:
				say "You withdraw...[paragraph break]";
			otherwise if the noun is down:
				say "You descend...[paragraph break]";
			wait for any key;
			clear only the main screen;
			say line break;
			now the endoscopic location is the room the noun from the endoscopic location;
			update backdrop positions;
			surreptitiously reckon darkness;
			try looking;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if the noun is up:
			end the endoscopy, followed by looking;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if the noun is down:
			say "You cannot go any further.";
			stop the action;
		otherwise:
			say "You can only go up or down.";
			stop the action;
	otherwise if we are descending:
		continue the action;
	otherwise if we are exiting:
		end the endoscopy, followed by looking;
		stop the action;
	otherwise if we are doing something with a thing (called the curiosity) enclosed by the endoscopic location:
		if we are searching or looking under:
			try examining the noun;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if we are examining:
			continue the action;
		otherwise:
			say "You can only examine [regarding the curiosity][them].";
			stop the action;
	otherwise if the current action involves the endoscopic-endoscope:
		if we are searching or looking under:
			try examining the noun;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if we are examining:
			continue the action;
		otherwise if we are pulling or taking:
			try going up;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if we are pushing or dropping:
			try going down;
			stop the action;
		otherwise if we are opening, closing, knocking on, squeezing, swinging, touching, tickling, or turning:
			say "You adjust the lenses.";
			stop the action;
		otherwise:
			say "You cannot do that.";
			stop the action;
	otherwise if we are examining down or examining inside:
		say "You see only darkness.";
		stop the action;
	otherwise if we are examining a direction:
		say "The endoscope is not articulated enough to do that.";
		stop the action;
	otherwise if we are waiting:
		say "You adjust the lenses.";
		stop the action;
	otherwise:
		end the endoscopy;
		continue the action.
		
[Since the before stage doesn't run for out of world actions, this still allows saving, loading, asking for help, and so on.]
		
endoscopy-exit-tutorial-quipped is a truth state that varies.
	
To quip the endoscopy exit tutorial:
	if endoscopy-exit-tutorial-quipped is false:
		say "(Type >[bold type]out[roman type] to end the endoscopy.)";
		now endoscopy-exit-tutorial-quipped is true.

Chapter 2.3.10.3 - Starting and Ending an Endoscopy

endoscopy-tutorial-quipped is a truth state that varies.

To start an endoscopy on (victim name - some text) via (the aperture - some text) to (destination - a room):
	say "You insert the endoscope into [the aperture]...[paragraph break]";
	wait for any key;
	now the player is engaged in endoscopy;
	now the endoscopic location is the destination;
	now the endoscopic subject text is "Inspecting [victim name]";
	if the number of characters in the endoscopic subject text is greater than 14, now right alignment depth is the number of characters in the endoscopic subject text;
	clear the screen;
	redraw status line;
	say line break;
	try looking.
	
To end the endoscopy, followed by looking:
	say "You withdraw upward...[paragraph break]";
	wait for any key;
	now the player is not engaged in endoscopy;
	now right alignment depth is 14;
	clear the screen;
	redraw status line;
	say line break;
	say "You clean the endoscope and put it in your pocket.[paragraph break]";
	if followed by looking, try looking.

To say general-hints-text:
	say "[bold type]General hints for play[roman type]

[italic type]The Weight of the Soul[roman type] is a game about investigation and problem-solving. Take your time and examine your surroundings, especially things that seem out of place or things that could be connected to the greater mystery at hand. Don't be afraid to ask around, explore, and get your hands dirty. Only look at hints if you're completely stuck and need guidance.

Marid is a capable and perceptive protagonist, and she usually has a good idea of where to go next. The Journal shows your current objective, a list of clues you've found, and Marid's thoughts on the situation. You can also consult Characters to refresh your memory on important personages you've encountered, or Map for a street map of the Channelworks District.

[italic type]The Weight of a Soul[roman type] is a very forgiving game. (It's rated 'Polite' on the Zarfian Cruelty Scale, if you know what that is.) Nevertheless, some sections of it have deadly time limits, and it [italic type]is[roman type] possible for the story to end badly for Marid. It is recommended to >[bold type]save[roman type] if you find yourself in a dire situation. If you get a game over, you can >[bold type]undo[roman type] a few times to retrace your steps and try again.";

Volume 3 - The Channelworks District

[The Channelworks District was designed to be a microcosm of Furopolis. I wanted the game to highlight many facets of the same city: rich vs. poor, magitech vs. improvised materials, lawful vs. unlawful. The four quarters of the Channelworks District were designed to evoke that.

I had a canal run through the district and define it because I think canals are cool.]

Part 3.1.3 - Ambience

[This part governs random events that sometimes trigger in various areas, to create a sense of liveliness in the Channelworks District. There are a number of backdrop objects which can be placed in rooms to provide them with ambience. The actual ambience text is provided by tables which we shuffle and cycle through in random order.]

An ambience object is a kind of backdrop.
An ambience object can be active or inactive. An ambience object is usually active.
An ambience object has a table name called the associated table.
An ambience object has a number called the message index. The message index is usually 1.

The ambience cooldown timer is a number that varies. The ambience cooldown timer is 3.

Ambience suppression is a truth state that varies.

When play begins (this is the shuffle the ambience rule):
	sort the Table of Day One Upper Perioch ambience in random order;
	sort the Table of Day Two Upper Perioch ambience in random order;
	sort the Table of Day One Riggertown ambience in random order.

Every turn (this is the ambience rule):
	if ambience suppression is false:
		if an active ambience object is in the location:
			decrement the ambience cooldown timer;
			if the ambience cooldown timer is 0:
				now the ambience cooldown timer is a random number from 3 to 4;
				let the relevant ambience be a random active ambience object in the location;
				say the happening in row message index of the relevant ambience of associated table of the relevant ambience;
				say line break;
				increment the message index of the relevant ambience;
				if the message index of the relevant ambience is greater than the number of rows in the associated table of the relevant ambience:
					now the message index of the relevant ambience is 1;
					sort the associated table of the relevant ambience in random order;
	otherwise:	
		now ambience suppression is false.
		
First report going (this is the suppress ambience when entering a room for the first time rule):
	if the location is unvisited:
		now ambience suppression is true.

Understand "fluid/effluvium" or "stream" or "stain/stains" or "spiderweb" or "pattern" or "blackened" or "vessel/vessels/artery/arteries/arterial" or "tissue/tissues" or "drop/drops/droplet/droplets" as the streams of black blood.
Instead of doing anything other than examining or rubbing with the streams of black blood, say "The fluid could be contagious. You shouldn't interact carelessly with it."
Instead of doing anything when the second noun is the streams of black blood, say "The fluid could be contagious. You shouldn't interact carelessly with it."

Part 3.2.5 - Surgery Room during Prologue

Doctor Cavala is in the Surgery Room.

When play begins (this is the print the introduction rule):

first-message-and-help-text-shown is a truth state that varies.

Chapter 3.2.5.1 - Reden's Surgical Procedure

[This is a minigame where you help Doctor Cavala find stuff for the procedure, potentially prolonging Reden's life. He dies either way, but it's good for atmosphere.]

The CSORSP [current step of Reden's surgical procedure] is a number that varies. The CSORSP is 1.

A purely-surgical-necessity is a kind of thing. [These things will be removed from play when Reden's Surgery ends.]
A purely-surgical-necessity has some text called the terse appellation.
Instead of doing anything when the noun is a purely-surgical-necessity or the second noun is a purely-surgical-necessity:
	if the action name part of the current action is:
		-- the examining action: continue the action;
		-- the pulling action: continue the action;
		-- the removing it from action: continue the action;
		-- the taking action: continue the action;
	say "You don't have time for that."

The Reden's surgery holding zone is a container. [This holds surgical necessities that are ready to go on stage when Marid examines the appropriate thing.]

Every turn during Reden's Surgery (this is the Reden's surgical procedure minigame rule):
	choose row CSORSP in the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure;
	if there is no item required entry:
		advance Reden's surgical procedure;
	otherwise if the Table of Reden's Agonizing Demise is not empty:
		choose a random row in the Table of Reden's Agonizing Demise;
		say "[happening entry][paragraph break]";
		blank out the whole row.

To advance Reden's surgical procedure:
	increase the CSORSP by 1;
	choose row CSORSP in the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure;
	say "[happening entry][paragraph break]";
	if there is a spawned items entry:
		repeat with current item running through the spawned items entry:
			now the current item is in the Reden's surgery holding zone.
			
Report asking for help during Reden's Surgery (this is the show message after help menu rule):
	choose row CSORSP in the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure;
	if there is no item required entry:
		say "[happening entry][paragraph break]";
		
Report asking for commands during Reden's Surgery (this is the show message after commands menu rule):
	choose row CSORSP in the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure;
	if there is no item required entry:
		say "[happening entry][paragraph break]";
		
Report asking for journal during Reden's Surgery (this is the show message after journal menu rule):
	choose row CSORSP in the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure;
	if there is no item required entry:
		say "[happening entry][paragraph break]";
		
Report asking for characters during Reden's Surgery (this is the show message after characters menu rule):
	choose row CSORSP in the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure;

'Fine!' Doctor Cavala says. 'We'll do this without anaesthetic, one way or another.' She gives the straps another pull and bends over Reden's body. 'Bleeding... arterial...' She snaps her fingers. 'Marid, get me the stethoscope.'

Chapter 3.2.5.4 - What Not to Do During Life-and-Death Surgery

Instead of talking to Doctor Cavala during Reden's Surgery:
	if there is an item required in row CSORSP of the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure:
		say "Doctor Cavala asked you to find [the terse appellation of the item required in row CSORSP of the Table of Reden's Surgical Procedure] and give it to her.";
	otherwise:
		say "[run paragraph on]".
		
Instead of waiting during Reden's Surgery, say "[run paragraph on]".
Instead of listening to the Surgery Room during Reden's Surgery, say "[run paragraph on]".
Instead of listening to Doctor Cavala during Reden's Surgery, say "[run paragraph on]".

Instead of switching off the lamps during Reden's Surgery, say "But a surgery is in progress."

Instead of going from the Surgery Room during Reden's Surgery, say "Doctor Cavala has not given up hope, and neither should you."

Instead of doing anything other than examining or listening to Reden during Reden's Surgery, say "You can't disturb the patient at this critical juncture."
Instead of doing anything when the second noun is Reden during Reden's Surgery, say "You can't disturb the patient at this critical juncture."

Instead of doing anything other than examining or listening to Doctor Cavala during Reden's Surgery, say "You can't disturb Doctor Cavala, not now."

Part 3.2.6 - Surgery Room during Heroes Never Die

When Heroes Never Die begins (this is the spawn the Heroes Never Die stuff in the surgery room rule):
	now the thousand pulsing dimensions are in the Surgery Room;
	now the spectral afterimages are in the Surgery Room;
	now Reden's animus is in the Surgery Room.

When Heroes Never Die ends (this is the despawn the freaky Heroes Never Die stuff in the surgery room rule):
	now the thousand pulsing dimensions are nowhere;
	now the spectral afterimages are nowhere.

Some thousand pulsing dimensions are a faraway scenery thing.
The description is "Echoes? Imprints?"
The thousand pulsing dimensions have some text called the faraway response. The faraway response of the thousand pulsing dimensions is "Your head hurts just thinking about that."
Understand "dimension" or "chamber" or "illuminated" as the thousand pulsing dimensions.

Some spectral afterimages are a faraway scenery thing.
The description is "They have the shapes of people. Almost."
The spectral afterimages have some text called the faraway response. The faraway response of the spectral afterimages is "You're not sure you want to."
Understand "afterimage" or "image" or "specter/spectre/specters/spectres" or "edge" or "of/-- vision" as the spectral afterimages.
Instead of talking to the spectral afterimages, say "You know, somehow, that they would not hear you."

Reden's animus is a ghostly goblin man. "You can sense Reden's animus lingering here."
The description is "[if Heroes Never Die is happening]He is cracked but somehow whole[otherwise]You focus and his image appears in your mind: shimmering, shattered, with black-blooded eyes[end if]."
The scent is "He smells of alcohol and death."
Understand "Reden" or "patient" or "fractured/shattered/cracked" or "cracks" or "shimmering" as Reden's animus.

Reden's ghostly eyes are part of Reden's animus.
The description is "His eyes gaze into infinity."
Understand "black" as Reden's ghostly eyes.
Does the player mean doing something with Reden's ghostly eyes: it is very likely.

Instead of going south when the location is the Surgery Room and Heroes Never Die is happening:
	say "[one of]You briefly consider turning around and walking right back out. But no[or]You have to see this through[stopping].";
	
Instead of talking to Reden's animus when Heroes Never Die is happening:
	start a dialogue with Reden's animus using dialogue reden-hnd-intro.

Chapter 3.3.5.4 - First Aid on Cavala

[This is a multi-step procedure similar to Reden's surgery.]

The CSOFAOC [current step of first aid on Cavala] is a number that varies.

Section 3.3.5.4.1 - Cavala First Aid Dialogue

Some dialogue branches are defined by the Table of Cavala First Aid Dialogue.

Table of Cavala First Aid Dialogue
dialogue branch	enabled	one-shot	prompt	description	choices
cavala-firstaid-home	true	false	""	""	{cavala-firstaid-doctor, cavala-firstaid-ohprimes}

cavala-firstaid-ohprimes	true	false	"'Oh Primes...'"	"'Oh Primes...'

[cavala-firstaid-examinewound]"	{}

To say cavala-firstaid-examinewound:
	say "You rush to Doctor Cavala's side. Even from a cursory examination, it's obvious that she needs help, and quickly.

'Hurry,' she says through gritted teeth. 'There's a first aid bag behind the counter...'

[wait for any key](This scene has lethal consequences. You may wish to save the game by typing >[bold type]save[roman type].) ";

Section 3.3.5.4.2 - Setting the Scene

Rule for writing a paragraph about Doctor Cavala during First Aid on Cavala:
	say "Doctor Cavala is lying on the floor in pain.";
	
Instead of examining Doctor Cavala during First Aid on Cavala: [If for some reason we've never examined Doctor Cavala, this bypasses the suspense-killing initial description of her.]
	if the CSOFAOC is:
		-- 1:
			say "She's bleeding heavily.";
		-- 2:
			say "She's bleeding heavily. You need to dress her leg and bandage it.";
		-- 3:
			say "The bandage is compressing the wound nicely, but you still need to raise her leg above chest level to halt the bleeding.";
	
The galvanic cutter is a faraway thing.
The description is "It looks like the doctor kept a souvenir from her volunteering days."
The scent is "You can still detect the faint smell of ozone."
The galvanic cutter has some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "It's a cutting tool. You shouldn't be touching it without a good reason."
Understand "lightning" or "cutting" or "tool" as the galvanic cutter.

When First Aid on Cavala begins (this is the initialize First Aid on Cavala rule):
	now the galvanic cutter is carried by Doctor Cavala;
	now Doctor Cavala's leg is part of Doctor Cavala;
	now the first aid bag is described;
	now the CSOFAOC is 1.
	
Section 3.3.5.4.3 - Step 1, Get the First Aid Bag

Instead of talking to Doctor Cavala while the CSOFAOC is 1:
	say "[one of]'Doctor --'

'Get the first aid bag!' she hisses.[or]She doesn't look to be in any state to talk.[stopping]"
	
The first aid bag is a closed openable undescribed container in the Clinic. "A first aid bag is behind the counter."
[It has no description because we want to show its contents and nothing else.]

Does the player mean doing something with the first aid bag when First Aid on Cavala is happening: it is very likely.

Instead of inserting something into the first aid bag:
	if the noun is the antiseptic dressing or the noun is the elastic bandage:
		say "You need that right now.";
	otherwise:
		say "That doesn't belong in the first aid bag."
		
Instead of closing the first aid bag while the first aid bag is open and the CSOFAOC < 3, say "No, you still need the first aid bag."
Instead of emptying the first aid bag into when First Aid on Cavala is happening, say "This is not the time to be making a mess."
	
Instead of doing anything with the first aid bag when Cavala's Errands has not ended (this is the block actions on the first aid bag before First Aid on Cavala rule):
	if we are examining the first aid bag:
		say "A bulky cloth bundle. It's behind the presciption counter.";
	otherwise if we are opening or searching the first aid bag:
		say "You check the contents of the first aid bag. Good -- everything is still intact. You close the bag.";
	otherwise:
		say "You shouldn't meddle with the first aid bag. You never know when it might be needed."
		
Instead of doing anything with the first aid bag when First Aid on Cavala has ended (this is the block actions on the first aid bag after First Aid on Cavala rule):
	if we are examining the first aid bag:
		say "A bulky cloth bundle. It's behind the presciption counter.";
	otherwise if we are opening or searching the first aid bag:
		say "You check the contents of the first aid bag. It looks like there are still enough supplies to last a while. You close the bag.";
	otherwise:
		say "You shouldn't meddle with the first aid bag. You never know when it might be needed again."
		
Before examining, searching, or looking under the prescription counter when the CSOFAOC is 1:
	say "There it is.[paragraph break]";
	try taking the first aid bag instead.

Instead of examining, opening, searching, or taking the first aid bag when the CSOFAOC is 1 (this is the getting the first aid bag rule):
	now the first aid bag is carried by the player;
	now the first aid bag is open;
	say "You grab the bag and wrest it open. Inside are a bellows, an aspirator, a stethoscope, a blood pressure gauge, a pair of scissors, a pair of tweezers, a bar of soap, a roll of tape, five vials (containing saline, laudanum, smelling salts, [italic type]aqua vitae[roman type], and tincture-of-resins)--

There. An antiseptic dressing and an elastic bandage.";
	now ambience suppression is true;
	now the CSOFAOC is 2.

Section 3.3.5.4.4 - Step 2, Bandage the Wound

Instead of talking to Doctor Cavala while the CSOFAOC is 2:
	say "[one of]'Just hang on,' you tell the doctor. 'I found a dressing and a bandage. I'm going to try to stop the bleeding...'[or]Never mind talking. You need to bandage the doctor before she bleeds out.[stopping]"

An antiseptic dressing is a key-item in the first aid bag.
The printed name is "dressing".
The description is "You need it to dress Doctor Cavala's leg."
The scent is "The calomel solution is still active."
Understand "calomel" or "solution" or "gauze" as the antiseptic dressing.
Instead of dropping the antiseptic dressing when the antiseptic dressing is carried, say "No. You can't fumble now."
Does the player mean doing something with the antiseptic dressing when First Aid on Cavala is happening: it is very likely.

An elastic bandage is a key-item in the first aid bag.
The printed name is "bandage".
The description is "You need it to bandage Doctor Cavala's leg."
The scent is "It smells a bit musty, but that's the last thing you care about at the moment."
Understand "bandages" or "fabric" as the elastic bandage.
Instead of dropping the elastic bandage when the antiseptic dressing is carried, say "No. You can't fumble now."
Does the player mean doing something with the elastic bandage when First Aid on Cavala is happening: it is very likely.

Some other first aid supplies are a thing in the first aid bag.
Rule for printing the name of the other first aid supplies when the number of things in the first aid bag is 1: say "first aid supplies".
Instead of doing anything with the other first aid supplies, say "You don't need any of the other things right now."
Understand "bellows" or "aspirator" or "stethoscope" or "pair" or "blood pressure" or "gauge" or "of" or "scissors" or "tweezers" or "bar" or "soap" or "roll" or "tape" or "vial/vials" or "saline" or "laudanum" or "aqua" or "vitae" or "smelling" or "salt/salts" or "tincture-of-resins" or "tincture" or "resin/resins" as the other first aid supplies.

Before tying something to when the CSOFAOC is 2 (this is the convert tying to bandaging during First Aid on Cavala rule):
	if Doctor Cavala is the noun, try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the second noun instead;
	if Doctor Cavala's leg is the noun, try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the second noun instead;
	if Doctor Cavala is the second noun, try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the noun instead;
	if Doctor Cavala's leg is the second noun, try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the noun instead.
	
Before putting something on when the CSOFAOC is 2 and (the second noun is Doctor Cavala or the second noun is Doctor Cavala's leg) (this is the convert putting to bandaging during First Aid on Cavala rule):
	try bandaging Doctor Cavala with the noun instead.

Before bandaging Doctor Cavala with when the CSOFAOC is 2 (this is the bandaging works during First Aid on Cavala rule):
	if the second noun is the antiseptic dressing or the second noun is the elastic bandage:
		let L be a list of things;
		if the antiseptic dressing is not carried:
			try silently taking the antiseptic dressing;
			add the antiseptic dressing to L;
		if the elastic bandage is not carried:
			try silently taking the elastic bandage;
			add the elastic bandage to L;
		say "(first taking [L with definite articles])[command clarification break]";
		dress and bandage Doctor Cavala's leg;
		stop the action;
	otherwise:
		say "You need a dressing and a bandage."

First every turn when the CSOFAOC is 2 (this is the automatically bandage Doctor Cavala when materials are gathered rule):
	if the player carries the antiseptic dressing and the player carries the elastic bandage:
		dress and bandage Doctor Cavala's leg.

To dress and bandage Doctor Cavala's leg:
	now the antiseptic dressing is nowhere;
	now the elastic bandage is nowhere;
	say "'There's no debris.' Doctor Cavala's voice is shaking. 'Remember. Apply pressure --'

She cries out as the dressing touches her wound. You force yourself to ignore her gasps, press down hard, loop the bandage tight. And natron sigils flare on the fabric: the wound is sealed.

'Not... not bad,' she croaks, when she has the voice to speak.

[wait for any key]'Can you move?' you ask.

[wait for any key]Her face twitches.

'Primes, it hurts. I... I think my tendon's gone.'

[wait for any key]'You're still bleeding,' you tell her. 'I need to --'

	now the CSOFAOC is 3;
	now cavala-firstaid-event-timer is 0;
	now Doctor Cavala is wearing the hermetically sealed bandage.

Section 3.3.5.4.5 - Step 3, Raise the Leg

Instead of talking to Doctor Cavala while the CSOFAOC is 3:
	say "[one of]'Are you going to be okay?' you ask.

'I'll manage,' Doctor Cavala replies. 'As soon as you raise my leg so that my circulation doesn't kill me.'[or]Doctor Cavala just glares at you.[stopping]";
	now ambience suppression is true.
	
Does the player mean putting Doctor Cavala on the waiting chairs: it is likely.

Before putting something on the waiting chairs when the CSOFAOC is 3 (this is the convert putting to taking for first aid rule):
	if the noun is Doctor Cavala or the noun is Doctor Cavala's leg:
		try taking Doctor Cavala instead.

Before pushing, pulling, or taking Doctor Cavala's leg when the CSOFAOC is 3 (this is the convert injury actions to Doctor Cavala actions for first aid rule):
	try taking Doctor Cavala instead.
	
Before pushing, pulling, or taking Doctor Cavala when the first aid bag is carried and the CSOFAOC is 3 (this is the drop the first aid bag before raising Doctor Cavala's leg for first aid rule):

You think for a moment. 'He... could have visited the Crow's Nest as well?'

She shakes her head. 'Think about it. Being seen in the Shanty Quarter, among thieves and lepers, would have destroyed his reputation as a financial businessman. More than that -- why haven't we heard of any other deaths in the Shanty Quarter? You've been there. You would have seen if anyone was exhibiting similar symptoms, and Crow or Webster would have mentioned it if there had been others. It couldn't possibly have started in the Shanty Quarter and only affected four people.'

[wait for any key]'I didn't see any signs of the disease,' you admit. 'The squatters weren't bleeding black or anything like that --'

She inclines her head. 'We know that the symptoms surface quickly. If it wasn't the Shanty Quarter, it must have been something else.'"	{cavala-rwmq-conclusion2a, cavala-rwmq-conclusion2b, cavala-rwmq-conclusion2c}

Doctor Cavala crosses her arms. Her eyes trace the bandages around her destroyed tendon.

'Suppose we assume that this is deliberate,' she says. 'That this is part of someone's larger agenda. Many things fall into place -- the attack on my clinic, the connection to the Trading Company, the fast-acting and improbably lethal affliction.

'Until now, we've been operating under the assumption that this is a simple infection, one that obeys statistics and adheres to the precepts of medicine... but what if that isn't the case? What if this is, in reality, a series of murders?'

[wait for any key]You regard her with growing unease. 'Then... then that would be beyond us. It would be a matter for the Vigiles.'

She nods grimly. 'Correct. And if this is true, Marid... whoever is behind this has it out for me. The culprit might be looking to bury the evidence, silence the doctors in the district who have a chance of stopping them --'

[wait for any key]'That means Doctor Justinian is in danger.'

'And you as well.' Doctor Cavala shakes her head. 'I'm sorry, Marid. If I had known earlier, I would never have sent you out on your own...'

[wait for any key]She shifts in her makeshift bed, wincing as the dressing on her leg chafes. Her shoulders are tense as she checks items off her fingers.

'If our conclusion is correct, time is of the essence. I will correspond with Doctor Justinian as soon as possible, and warn the Vigiles by way of Horatio. The quarantine will buy us some time to track down the culprit. As for you, Marid --'

[wait for any key]She looks at you, and something causes her to falter. She closes her eyes. Her words catch in her throat.

[wait for any key]'Go home and rest,' she says. 'You've done your part. I'll handle things from here on.'"	{cavala-rwmq-yesdr, cavala-rwmq-wanttohelp}

Section 3.3.7.1.3 - A Scene of Eldritch Light and Mild Concern

Before going inside when the location is the Clinic and Heroes Never Die is happening (this is the going inside during Heroes Never Die means going to the surgery room rule):
	try going north instead.
	
Some light not of this world is a faraway scenery thing.
The description is "It has no shape, and yet you [italic type]see[roman type]."
The sound is "Silence."
The light not of this world has some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "You don't know how you would begin."
Understand "imprint/imprints" or "long" or "shadow" or "grim" as the light not of this world.
Does the player mean doing something with the light not of this world:
	it is very likely.

When Heroes Never Die begins (this is the spawn the eldritch light in the Clinic rule):
	now the light not of this world is in the Clinic.
When Heroes Never Die ends (this is the despawn the eldritch light in the Clinic rule):
	now the light not of this world is nowhere.

Before going through the clinic front door when Heroes Never Die is happening:

Before going through the mortuary stairs when Heroes Never Die is happening:
	say "You can't go there. Not now." instead.

Book 3.4 - Mortuary

The Mortuary is a proper-named room. "The odor of tinctured camphor is overwhelming in this gloomy subterranean chamber. Shelves along the walls house organs in jars of formaldehyde. Deeper in, cadavers are organized in labeled niches, embalmed and awaiting cremation.

A flight of stairs leads back up to the clinic."

The scent is "The smell of embalming fluid blankets everything here."
The exit reminder is "The only way out is back upstairs, to the clinic proper."

The simple-name is "the mortuary".
Before examining up in the Mortuary, try examining the stairs to the mortuary instead.
Before examining outside in the Mortuary, try examining the stairs to the mortuary instead.
Before going outside in the Mortuary, try going up instead.

Part 3.4.1 - Stairs to the Mortuary

Some stairs to the mortuary are an open unopenable scenery door. They are below the Clinic and above the Mortuary.
The description is "[if the player is in the Clinic]The stairs lead into darkness.[otherwise]Light streams down the stairs."
Understand "exit" as the stairs to the mortuary when the location is the Mortuary.

After going through the mortuary stairs while the player is staid: say "[if the previous location is the Clinic]You descend the steps into shadow...[paragraph break][otherwise]You emerge from the darkness of the mortuary...[paragraph break]"; continue the action.

Before putting something on the stairs to the mortuary, try dropping the noun instead.
Instead of smelling the stairs to the mortuary in the Clinic, say "The smell of embalming fluid is faint, but distinctive."

Part 3.4.2 - Scenery

The odor of tinctured camphor is scenery in the Mortuary.
Understand "embalming" or "fluid" as the odor of tinctured camphor.
Before examining or smelling the odor of tinctured camphor, try smelling the location instead.
Instead of doing anything other than examining or smelling to the odor of tinctured camphor, say "You can only smell it."

Some shelves of organs are a scenery supporter in the Mortuary.
The description is "The jars are meticulously labeled with names and dates."
Understand "organ" or "shelf" or "jar/jars" or "formaldehyde" or "eyeball/eyeballs" or "kidney/kidneys" or "liver/livers" or "name/names" or "date/dates" as the shelves of organs.
Instead of entering the shelves of organs, say "The shelves wouldn't support your weight."
Instead of searching the shelves of organs, say "There are twenty or thirty jars here. They contain eyeballs, kidneys, livers, and so on."
Instead of taking the shelves of organs, say "You can't imagine how that would be useful."
Instead of putting something on the shelves of organs, say "Doctor Cavala would be quite annoyed to find your things mixed in with the jars."
Instead of opening the shelves of organs, say "Formaldehyde is quite toxic. You shouldn't expose yourself to more than you have to."
Instead of removing something from the shelves of organs, say "You can't imagine how that would be useful."

The mortuary slab is a scenery supporter in the Mortuary.
Instead of examining the mortuary slab, say "It's a dais for cadavers to be laid on[if Reden's Autopsy is happening]. Reden's body and organs are presently occupying it[end if]."
Instead of entering the mortuary slab, say "[if Reden's Autopsy is happening]You shouldn't disturb Doctor Cavala while she's performing the autopsy.[otherwise]There's no need for that."
Instead of putting something on the mortuary slab when Reden's Autopsy is happening, say "Reden's body is already occupying the slab."

Some labeled niches are a scenery container in the Mortuary.
Understand "niche" as the labeled niches.
Instead of entering the labeled niches, say "You aren't dead yet, Marid."
Instead of examining the labeled niches, say "For each niche, a body."
Instead of inserting something into the labeled niches, say "The niches are reserved for cadavers."

Some embalmed cadavers are a dead mixed-race person in the labeled niches.
The description is "You feel a chill when you look at them."
Instead of searching the cadavers, say "All of the cadavers have been stripped of clothing and personal effects."
Instead of pulling or taking the cadavers, say "You can't imagine why you would want to do that."

Part 3.4.3 - Mortuary during Day One

[Day One begins when Reden is moved to the mortuary slab, so we don't have to specify that here.]

Instead of going from the Mortuary during Nine to Five Zombie, say "You should talk to Doctor Cavala to let her know you're here."

Chapter 3.4.3.1 - Reden and his Organs

Instead of cutting Reden during Reden's Autopsy, say "You should leave the autopsy to Doctor Cavala."
Instead of knocking on, pushing, pulling, rubbing, squeezing, taking, touching, or turning Reden during Reden's Autopsy, say "Not in the middle of an autopsy."

Reden's-organs are a plural-named privately-named scenery thing on the mortuary slab. The printed name is "Reden's organs".
The description is "Reden's organs are black and withered. You might have suspected poor embalming technique if it hadn't been Doctor Cavala performing the dissection."
Understand "Reden's" or "organ/organs" or "heart" or "lungs" or "trachea" or "respiratory" or "system" as Reden's-organs.
Instead of cutting Reden's-organs, say "You should leave the autopsy to Doctor Cavala."
Instead of eating Reden's-organs, say "Diseased organs are not food, Marid."
Instead of knocking on, pushing, pulling, rubbing, squeezing, taking, touching, turning, or waving Reden's-organs, say "You shouldn't handle the organs carelessly."

When Reden's Autopsy begins (this is the shift Reden's organs for Reden's Autopsy rule):
	now Reden's-organs are on the mortuary slab.
	
When Reden's Autopsy ends (this is the despawn Reden rule):
	now Reden is nowhere;
	now Reden's-organs are nowhere.

Chapter 3.4.3.2 - Cavala during Reden's Autopsy
	
Rule for writing a paragraph about Doctor Cavala during Reden's Autopsy:
	say "Doctor Cavala is here studying Reden's body with a loupe. His heart, lungs, and trachea are neatly laid out beside him on the slab.";
	now Reden is mentioned.
	
Instead of kissing, knocking on, pushing, pulling, rubbing, squeezing, taking, touching, or turning Doctor Cavala during Reden's Autopsy, say "She wouldn't like to be disturbed in the middle of an autopsy. Talking to her will be enough to get her attention."

The surgical loupe is a wearable thing.
The description is "A special adjustable lens, capable of a high degree of tunnel magnification."
Understand "special" or "adjustable" or "lens" as the surgical loupe.
Before searching the surgical loupe, say "It's difficult to look through the loupe without wearing it." instead.

When Reden's Autopsy begins (this is the initialize Doctor Cavala for Reden's Autopsy rule):
	now Doctor Cavala is in the Mortuary;
	now Doctor Cavala is wearing the surgical loupe;
	now the home dialogue branch of Doctor Cavala is cavala-errands.
	
When Reden's Autopsy ends (this is the despawn the surgical loupe when Reden's Autopsy ends rule):
	now the surgical loupe is nowhere.

There is a proper-named room in Outdoors called the Via Mercurii. "The Road of Change is a snaking, secretive thing. It curls in the side streets and in the dark places.

'Ah, love.' The fortune-teller smiles. 'It tangles the strings of fate and leads us in mysterious ways. The pattern for it is sometimes known as the Dove's Tail, but I prefer to call it the Heart.'

He sweeps the deck across the table with a flourish, spreading out five cards in the shape of an arrowhead -- or, you suppose, a symbolic heart. At its very tip, he lays another card perpendicular over the first.

[wait for any key]The last card is a woman all in white, kneeling beside a dying man.

[wait for any key]The fortune-teller picks up the sideways card, his hand trembling slightly. You realize he is holding it upside down.

'The Healer,' he says. 'Inverted.'

[wait for any key]You inhale sharply.

'Don't -- don't worry. It's not as literal as it might seem.' He takes a deep breath. 'The inverted Healer is a symbol of renouncement and parting. All it means is... that you and your love will one day be separated. Your relationship will not last forever. You should cherish it as long as you can.'

His hand continues to tremble."	{teller-isee, teller-lovereallymeans}
teller-lovereallymeans	true	false	"'Tell me what it really means.'"	"You look him in the eye. 'Tell me what it really means.'

The fortune-teller regards you for a long moment.

At last he says, 'One of you is fated to die.'

He places the Healer face down."	{teller-isee, teller-disbelieve2}
teller-work1	true	false	"'A man died in the clinic where I work...'"	"'A man died in the clinic where I work. I want to know what happened to him.'

The fortune-teller's smile fades, and he nods more seriously.

'You pose me a sober question, my friend,' he says. 'I will endeavor to ask the cards on your behalf. Let's see what the River pattern has to tell us about your patient.'

He upturns his hand. Cards slide off the deck and onto the table in a flowing line. With his other hand, he turns the path of the cascade until a curving tangent has been formed.

[wait for any key]'The River flows from the source,' he says, 'through the upper course and the bend, into the lower course and the delta; here, the tributary is fed by the lake.'

He gestures to each of the face-down cards in sequence.

'Now we will reveal the cards, one by one, and see what they reveal about the flow of causality.'

[wait for any key]His gold-gloved hand hovers over the source.

'Shall we begin?'"	{teller-work2}
teller-work2	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the upper river.>"	"You nod. The fortune-teller touches the source, and brings it to light.

[wait for any key]The illustration is of an ancient forge, immaculately detailed and filled with artifacts of esoteric design. You see swords and cups, cloaks and crowns. But in front and center, set above the rest, is a band of purest, most exalted gold.

[wait for any key]'The Ring,' says the fortune-teller. 'The most brilliant of the Fixtures. The source was a device, or perhaps a discovery, that possessed vast potential.'

[wait for any key]The next card is upside down, and all you can make out is a crowded and colorful vignette. But in the center, almost unnoticeable, is one stooped figure devoid of color.

[wait for any key]'The Servant. The lowliest in the realm of the court, so humble as to go unnoticed. But it is inverted; I dare say your patient drew unexpected attention, for good or for ill.'

[wait for any key]The third card bears a young woman's face in stark definition, with blue eyes eerily like your own, but with only pale skin where her mouth should have been. You involuntarily touch your lips.

[wait for any key]The fortune-teller shakes his head. 'The bend is the Mute. The event, then, the death, had to do with silence. But did your patient die because he did not speak out... or was he killed to ensure he never did?'

[wait for any key]He purses his lips.

'Let us take a step back, and see if the tributary sheds light on the mystery.'"	{teller-work3}
teller-work3	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the tributary.>"	"He reveals the card, and it turns out to be an idyllic scene of the land before the Darkening, a picture of a forest with green trees and blue skies. In its center is a body of still and silvery water.

[wait for any key]'The Pond,' says the fortune-teller. 'It represents a place far from civilization where one can reflect and find reflection. It is the indirect cause -- could the discovery have been made in such a place? The place your patient drew attention? Or did he not speak out because civilization would not have heard him?'

[wait for any key]You frown. 'I came here for answers, not more questions.'

'I am sorry you feel that way, my friend,' he replies. 'I can only convey what I can see with my own eyes, and what the cards see fit to provide. The Fates can be temperamental even at the best of times.

'But look! There are still three cards we have not revealed.'"	{teller-work4}
teller-work4	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the rest of the river.>"	"'We have seen what has come to pass,' he says, reaching for the lake. 'Now we see what could have been...'

[wait for any key]The card bears the image of an old woman in a dungeon. She is strung up by iron manacles and horribly withered, with her emaciation illustrated in exacting detail.

[wait for any key]'The Manacles.' A grimace. 'If not for your patient's death, someone would have been imprisoned. Yes, an unpleasant picture is beginning to emerge...'

[wait for any key]The fortune-teller turns over the lower course, revealing it to be another dark and disturbing illustration; but upside-down, so that you can only see a bone-white figure.

[wait for any key]'Ah!' he declares. 'The Ghost appears, but inverted. The dire message it brings is not heard, and the course of fate is not changed. And that brings us to our final card, the delta --'

[wait for any key]The delta is a storm at sea, heaving with rain-lashed ships and alive with forked lightning. Above all in the pitch-black sky is a terrible sphere that can only be the [italic type]Luna[roman type].

[wait for any key]The fortune-teller sets the card down.

'The Tempest,' he whispers. 'The future will be filled with change and turmoil. It could be in many years, or it could be tomorrow. And all because of a humble man who drew the wrong attention -- and was silenced.'

A long pause."	{teller-isee, teller-areyousure, teller-drivel}
teller-past1	true	false	"'I've been having nightmares...'"	"'I've been having nightmares. I've had them for years. I thought I got over them, but... I had another one, just last night.'

The fortune-teller grows sober. 'Dreams,' he says. 'Nightmares. They show us truths that cannot be found in the daylight. If you wish to learn how to conquer them, one pattern will prove most illuminating...'

He casts his hands apart, scattering the top cards of the deck with the sudden motion, and at first you wonder if he's dropped them by accident. But when the loose cards come to rest, they have landed in an deliberate, intricate pattern -- a cross.

[wait for any key]'The corners,' he says, tapping the cards at the end of each of the four arms. 'The spokes,' he continues, moving inward in counter-clockwise fashion. 'And the nexus --'

He taps the two cards in the center, one laid perpendicular over the other, and you nod transfixed.

[wait for any key]'The Crossroads.' he says. 'It shows us the paths that lead to our destination. Now we will reveal the cards, one by one, and see what they reveal about you.'

His gold-gloved hand hovers over the top left corner. 'Shall we begin?'"	{teller-past2}
teller-past2	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the corners.>"	"With great showmanship, he turns over the first card.

[wait for any key]Some kind of hound or beast stares out at you, with smoke-gray fur and menacing slitted eyes. The visage is unfamiliar, terrifying.

'The Wolf,' says the fortune-teller. 'It represents danger, and the fear that comes with isolation.'

[wait for any key]The next card depicts a girl at an old-fashioned spindle, with strings wound through her hands and feet and hair. But to your surprise, the card is upside down.

'The Seamstress, inverted.' the fortune-teller continues. 'In the past, you experienced a traumatic event -- one that severed the ties binding you to friends and family. You were set adrift.'

You feel a hollowness within you.

[wait for any key]The lower right card is a young girl flanked by skeletons, one male and one female, staring at you with hollow eye sockets, and you freeze.

[wait for any key]'The Orphan,' says the fortune-teller. 'I take it you have lost someone.'

[wait for any key]You can't find it in yourself to breathe.

'How are you doing this?' you whisper.

[wait for any key]His voice is quiet. 'I know only what the cards have shown me. But I see now why you might be plagued by nightmares.'"	{teller-paststop, teller-past3}
teller-paststop	true	false	"<Get up and walk away.>"	"You take a deep breath.

You choke on it. Tears well up in your eyes.

You look at the skeletons and you --

[wait for any key]-- hear his last words --

[wait for any key]-- all over again --[roman type]

[wait for any key]You squeeze your eyes shut.

[wait for any key]You take a deep breath.

Running won't solve anything. It won't make the nightmares go away.

[wait for any key]You have to see this through."	{teller-past3}
teller-past3	true	false	"<Stay seated.>"	"You grit your teeth. You grip your seat until your knuckles whiten.

'Are you all right?' The fortune-teller sounds genuinely concerned.

'I'm [italic type]fine.'[roman type]

A long pause.

'No,' he replies. 'You're not fine. You have been badly wounded.'

[wait for any key]The card in the lower left is a woman in white, kneeling beside a dying man, and it is upside down.

[wait for any key]You start to cry.

[wait for any key]It is the fortune-teller who first speaks again.

'There is no shame in tears,' he says. 'No one is so strong that she cannot weep.'

[wait for any key]Some time passes. You aren't sure how much.

[wait for any key]But it is with a defiant breath that you wipe away the last of your tears."	{teller-past4}
teller-past4	true	false	"'I'm all right. Let's move on.'"	"'I'm all right,' you say. 'Let's move on.'

The fortune-teller looks at you, then nods. His hand moves inward, to the top left spoke.

[wait for any key]Inward from the Wolf is a slab of horned metal, massive and unyielding. It glows with the heat of the flames surrounding it.

'The Anvil,' says the fortune-teller. 'Your trials have strengthened you more than you think. Fire will never break or bend you.'

[wait for any key]The spoke from the Seamstress shows an ancient road, leading straight ahead into the dawn on the horizon.

'The Path. Without ties to bind you, you are free to move ahead. You should look to the future, not the past.'

[wait for any key]From the Orphan, you see a woman in slumber, encircled by a tapestry of images executed in dizzying detail.

'The Dreamer. Yes, you are a dreamer in more than one sense, whether or not you realize it...'

[wait for any key]The final spoke is upside down, and it is illustrated only with a morass of dark shapes -- but the fortune-teller nods with apparent understanding.

'And from the Healer,' he says, 'the Shadows. Also inverted. Something will soon emerge from the shadows and be made known to you... and I suspect it is linked to everything that has gone before. But only you will see it.'

[wait for any key]The fortune-teller inclines his head.

'There are only two cards left. Let us see what the Fates have in store for you.'"	{teller-past5}
teller-past5	true	false	"<Watch him reveal the destination.>"	"He holds the upper card in place, while drawing out the lower. 'The destination,' he says, 'reveals the truth -- the true path that you must take...'

[wait for any key]The card is inverted. It shows a gray stone tablet, planted alongside flowers; the inscription is slick with rain, and there is a melancholy quality to the illustration.

'The Gravestone,' he says curiously. 'It represents mortality, inevitability. But inverted...'

[wait for any key]He furrows his brow, and without another word, turns over the other card.

[wait for any key]A storm at sea, heaving with rain-lashed ships and alive with forked lightning. Above all in the pitch-black sky is a terrible sphere that can only be the [italic type]Luna[roman type].

Book 3.22 - Shanty Quarter / Shanty Maze

There is a proper-named goto-impassable room in Outdoors called the Shanty Quarter. "A labyrinthine morass of concrete and claustrophobia. You know this place better now that you've seen the worst of it -- you know which paths to take, which alleys to avoid -- but there is a horror here that sinks its teeth into you, and does not lets go.

Tangled rope ladders lead up and down. A crumbling flophouse lies to the east. Somewhere to the north is the Via Mercurii, and to the west, Cadaver Walk."

The Shanty Maze is a region.

shanty-quarter-warning-given is a truth state that varies.

Before going south in the Via Mercurii when Day One is happening (this is the Day One Shanty Quarter warning rule):
	if Maze Part One is unvisited:
		if shanty-quarter-warning-given is false:
			say "The cobblestones grow crooked and broken underfoot. The buildings crowd inward until they blot out the darkening sky. You hesitate.

Is there really no other way?";
			now shanty-quarter-warning-given is true;
			now ambience suppression is true;
			stop the action;
		otherwise:
			say "With a deep breath, you press onward.";
			now the player is in Maze Part One;
			now the Shanty Quarter is visited;

Chapter 3.22.2.2 - Maze Part One (Shanty Quarter)

Maze Part One is a privately-named room in the Shanty Maze. "No words can describe this place. It is claustrophobic, oppressive, a place where light does not reach. The air is heavy with the stench of offal and waste, and other things better left unimagined -- and you are hemmed in by ropes, walled off by concrete, entombed with the walking dead[one of][or].

A labyrinth of crawlspaces and ladders and rag curtains surrounds you[stopping]."

The printed name is "Shanty Quarter".

Chapter 3.22.2.3 - Maze Part Two (Deeper, Darker)

Maze Part Two is a privately-named room in the Shanty Maze. "And you cannot find your way. All is awash in the spectral light of broken cathode lamps, and in the shadows phantasmagoria creeps. Frightened children eye you from the rooftops. Rats are strung up like hanged men."

The printed name is "Deeper, Darker".
The sound is "The walls echo with the sounds of laughter and tears."
The scent is "It smells horrible in here."

Section 3.32.2.1.2 - Zoiro Mourning Dialogue, Branching Investigative Section

[In this little specimen of spaghetti code, Marid asks Zoiro about various topics, which lead to new potential topics. What happens here is that all of the dialogue branches have every possible choice, but the 'enabled' property is only turned on for the branches once they have been unlocked.

We use the 'one-shot' property to see which branches have already been unlocked before so we don't unlock them again: false means they haven't been unlocked by the player, true means they have.

The starting branch is aboutreden, which branches to:
	-werentclose
	-placesfrequented
	-associations
	
From these we get the following:
	-unemployed
	-heleft
	-drinker
	
And finally the following critical clues:
	-channelworks
	-pub
	-redenshack
	
Once Marid has asked all of the final three, we unlock the final dialogue branch, which is alldone.]

[This character is a reference to XS, one of the best and most twisted questmistresses I've ever encountered on /tg/.]

Book 3.35 - Cellar

There is a room called the Cellar. "A dimly lit mouse-hole of a hollow that has been bricked off from prying eyes. A pair of mattresses lie near the entrance, where Sal and Piper must have slept.

Instead of emptying the waste bin into, say "You'd really rather not."
Instead of inserting something into the waste bin, say "You're loath to put your hand anywhere close to the bin."
Instead of taking the waste bin, say "You can't imagine why you would need this."

Some unprepossessing gray lumps are faraway scenery.
The description is "Gum. Pre-chewed."
The unprepossessing gray lumps have some text called the faraway response. The faraway response is "You'd really rather not."
Understand "gray" or "lump" or "chewed/chewing" or "gum" as the unprepossessing gray lumps.
Before smelling the unprepossessing gray lumps, try smelling the waste bin instead.

The disheveled shirt is a thing worn by Crow.
The description is "You don't think she particularly cares about her appearance."
Understand "loop/loops" or "trouser/trousers" or "crow's" as the disheveled shirt.

The feathered hairpin is a thing worn by Crow.
The description is "It's rather morbid."
Understand "feather/feathers" or "bone/bones" or "of" or "hair" or "pin" or "crow's" as the feathered hairpin.

Crow's stool is a scenery supporter in the Crow's Nest.
The description is "[The Crow]'s sitting on it."
Instead of searching Crow's stool, say "On the stool is [the Crow]."
Instead of entering Crow's stool, say "[The Crow] seems to be sitting on that."
Instead of pushing, pulling, squeezing, swinging, taking, touching, or turning Crow's stool, say "You don't think [the Crow] would appreciate that."
Instead of putting something on Crow's stool, say "[The Crow] seems to be sitting on that."

She takes a long swig from her own glass. For a long while she is silent, absorbed in her own thoughts.

She looks down and chuckles softly.

'But I always saw, when he was a few bottles in, that look in his eyes. He was always thinking, thinking of going back.

She looks into your eyes. 'I got found out after that,' she says. 'The whiskey, I mean. And then Reden took the heat, too, for supplying me. All three of us got handed our letters on that day.'

She drains the last of her glass, and runs a hand through her hair. For the first time since you've met her, she does not quite meet your eye.

[wait for any key]'You know,' she whispers, 'I still feel numb inside. Maybe it's the rum -- I keep thinking Reden's going to climb up the gangway any moment, asking for a bottle of the Bilious Canal's finest...'

There is a room in the Midnight Zone called the Scullery. "Your footsteps squelch in this stale, cramped space. The cobwebs here glitter with moisture and silk-wrapped things. Through your lamp-light flit flies, disturbed by your movements, crowding upon moldy plates and slime-encrusted piping.

[I decided to add another puzzle here to break up the gameplay. The lift will fall if you step in it, which means you have to use the ladder from the scullery to bridge the gap. But without the ladder, you can't access the maintenance shaft. The solution is to get a stool from the kitchen to climb on.]

"[if the service lift platform is intact]Engraved before you are the glyphs that conduct the galvanism of the service lift, and barely -- just barely -- keep it from plummeting away into the abyss[otherwise]You've scratched out the glyphs that were once inscribed here.
